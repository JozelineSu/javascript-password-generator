# JavaScript Password Generator

## Description

### This website generates a random password using JavaScript. It asks the user a series of questions, so they can get a custom password with their chosen characters. You can generate as many passwords as needed. 

## How It Works

### When the user clicks "Generate Password", they will be asked to choose the length of their password. As long as its within the 8 - 128 character limit, they will move on to build their password. They will choose at least one character option between: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Then, the website will display the new password. 

## Usage

### You can use this to make secure passwords for your login, as many times as needed.
